# PyMonitorMQTT

**Please refer to the [new website](https://richibrics.github.io/PyMonitorMQTT/)!**

If you want to use this Software with HomeAssistant, use [this configuration](https://github.com/richibrics/PyMonitorMQTT/blob/master/configuration-homeassistant.yaml) so Hass will automatically detect all the sensors and commands !

PyMonitorMQTT is a fully-customizable **cross-platform system monitor** (works both on Windows, Linux and macOS) that sends real time information via **MQTT**.

Information form this client are well managed by home automation systems like [HomeAssistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant).
**Companion integration for HomeAssistant can be found [here](https://github.com/richibrics/HassMonitorMqtt)** (OBSOLETE, YOU SHOULD USE THE DISCOVERY OPTION WITH THE SAMPLE CONFIGURATION YOU CAN FIND [HERE](https://github.com/richibrics/PyMonitorMQTT/blob/master/configuration-homeassistant.yaml))
